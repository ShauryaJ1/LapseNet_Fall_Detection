### Submitted by Shaurya Jain, Soham Jain, Anmol Karan

This fall detection system utilizes four datasets: UR Dataset, Multiple Cameras Fall Dataset, CAUCAFall Dataset, UBFC Fall Detection Dataset. It employs a CNN and LSTM structure to detect collapses in indoor environments at 100.0% testing accuracy. Paper is attached in the repository. NOTE: The paper has an IEEE Copyright
